          The keyboard is my paintbrush, my text editor is my canvas, and my language & framework are my medium. 
          In my opinion, programming is a functional form of art, which has the ability to change the lives of 
          people around the world. <br><br>

          Ever since writing my first C++ program in my into to programming class, I became obsessed with endless 
          possibilities and solutions software had to offer. Software engineering is a never ending puzzle that I am 
          passionately engaged in solving. <br><br>

          For my first <a href="./Mihai_Lapuste_CV.pdf" download>professional experience</a> as a programmer, 
          I was given the opportunity to lead the front-end development of a small startup’s web application. 
          This opportunity was monumental for me, as it radically changed my initial perceptions of professional 
          programming. It was not some dull grey office job, it was an exciting and engaging experience that constantly 
          challenged me to learn, creative, problem solve, design, and ultimately grow as a programmer and person.<br><br>

          After a year of work experience, I returned to school where I needed to declare my engineering major. 
          My overwhelmingly positive CO-OP experience as a developer made it and easy decision, and I chose Computer Engineering. <br><br>

          Currently, I’m in my final year of <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/engineering/About_Engineering_Science.html" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a> 
          where I am also a <a href="https://athletics.sfu.ca/roster.aspx?rp_id=4117" target="_blank">student-athlete</a> 
          on our NCAA DII SFU Men’s American Football team as a Redshirt Senior Quarterback.<br><br>
